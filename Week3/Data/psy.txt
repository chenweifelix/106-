I am just about to start my first year bachelor of psychological science in Australia and was wondering what people did in relation to textbooks including: 
- When they found was best to buy their needed books ( before starting or within a few weeks) 
- whether people preferred electronic textbooks over paper (would it be cheaper in the long run to just print out from e-text what you want physically) 
- if buying the actual book did you buy it second hand cheaper or brand new ~ if so where from? 
Also to add if any one has any tips with the entire experience of University as well as being a psychology student. 
Thank you <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
I am currently entering my senior year of undergrad and am looking for a mentor for advice regarding extending my education, internships, recommended readings, etc. 
A sixth sense
From anecdotal observations it seems to me that there is some channel of communication other than the traditional senses. I guess it can only be something electromagnetic. It should not be difficult to test this. If it was already been tried with negative results, it may be because it is something subtle, and mobilizing the attention to detect it may compromise the perception. The attention of the person could be kept busy with some puzzle in order for the person to have a better perception.
I am 26 years olds with a BA in Psych from Purdue University. I graduated in 2015 and now I'm trying to decide if I go back to school, which is going to be more practical for knowledge and gainful employment. Since I already have my BA in Psych would it set me above to add on an Associates in Social Work? Or just add onto to my already somewhat useless degree. With my BA in Psych getting an associates in business, would that show more promising employment opportunities for administrative jobs, HR, etc. I've researched all this for weeks and can't come across anything definitive. I can't afford to go on and get a Masters in Psych or Social Work, plus if I did it would have to be online, I suck at online schooling and most of them aren't accredited anyways.  
If anyone has similar degrees or pursuing this same path, or with employment knowledge with these degrees it would be much appreciated and thank you for your time. 
I just graduated with a BA in Psychology. I would like to work in research for a few years and then pursue a PhD program. I have applied to so many labs at various universities and even some zoos, and had only heard back from one (rejected). Has anyone else experienced this? How do you actually get someone to look at your application or give you an interview?! I have tried follow up emails, no replies to any of them. 
Can you suggest some good blogs about psychology (with newest and authentic research and findings) for a to-be psychology student (undergraduate) in order to enrich knowledge and understanding of the field? Thanks!
I'm nearly finished just taking a few classes online. I want to apply for a public service education position through a school district (FT yearly), working with parents and students in early intervention. Would they over look me having not completed the degree just yet. At my school they post a list of students hired before graduation although I'm not sure if that means they already started or it's contingent on after that semester. If I have a shot any advice? Thank you!
Hello, I’m choosing what to study in university and I would like to talk to current psychology students about their experiences 
I'm an engineer major so I bought a "new" calculus 3 book. I never needed the wileyplus code so I never used it. However, after cleaning my room recently I found the code and figure to give it to someone for free. After searching up for what course or book the code was for all I could find online using the code "9781118431047" was something called "psychology in action". So i figured i would post it in this page to see if it would help anyone, so if anyone needs something like this the code is "C4975-46238-22524-921". 
What is the reason that different societies have evolved different codes of morality? 
As someone who is basically an atheist now, I can't help but wonder if I have been myself been brainwashed by a different code of morality causing me to leave religion.
Another question arises- if morality really is just a human construct, how are we to know that our current code of morality is sensible?
Basically, what is morality?
I'm looking for colleges nearby, and the only one near me offers applied psychology. I don't really understand the difference. I'm  in highschool now, and am going to start my senior year. I've taken Psychology previously and loved it, I'm not to sure about a degree in applied psych?
Hello fellow Students,
I have a research paper that I need to do for Principles of Psychology. I kinda have a topic but I'm not sure it even falls into the "psychology" studies category. The Rubric is very generic. The instructor gave us almost free reign over the topic as long as its psychologically orientated/based. Bellow is the start of the Paper, but I'm not sure it counts as psychology per say. Can I get some feedback?
P.S
Let me know if I need to explain anything in more detail in order to get feedback sometimes I'm far too General at the start of my papers. Thanks!
The Human Organism
And its Biological Reflection
Humans have always congregated into community’s since we were hunter gathering society’s. We have developed culturally and technologically since that time, creating a huge human organism worldwide to survive. This organism’s reflection is one of biological systems that evolution has created over millions of years. Humans are not creating new systems just imitating the environment they evolved in.
I can't seem to ever focus my attention on a carrier/hobbie and it is really putting a stop to my life, personal growth, maturity, etc. When I do find something interesting I do look into it quite a lot ( I don't become extremely interested ) and then point my life focus to whatever I become most immersed in. Currently, my main interest is psychology but that may change. What is this?
Hi everyone, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.
I'm a 35 year old IT professional, and I've been a Federal contractor in Missouri for 2.5 years making ~$75,000 yr.
My job is pretty secure and the workload is very relaxed. 
Moving on, for the past 2-3 years I have had a desire to make a meaningful change. I really enjoy thinking about people and what makes us who we are and how we tick. I've recently started thinking heavily about working towards a career in Clinical Psychology. 
My formal education is pretty much non-existent aside from a few random Art courses a thousand years ago, so I'd have to start school from the beginning. I understand this will take many many years of hard work and of course money... Bottom line is I've been feeling like I haven't done enough of anything truly meaningful. I've always been the "listener and advice giver" because of my empathetic nature, and I very much enjoy it. 
Do you think the course workload is possible while maintaining a full time job? 
Is a career change at 35 even possible or worth it for that matter?
Is online a viable option for Psychology courses?
The salary is not as important to me as the potential rewarding work.
Basically I'd love to hear your opinions and thoughts on making a change such as this. 
Thank you again!
Hi Sub,
My gf and I recently graduated with Bachelor degrees, I received mine in Info systems and she received hers in Psychology. 
I’ve got an idea of what to work towards but my gf has no idea what to do now.  We’ve tried looking for entry level HR/IO assistant jobs, but they all seem to requirer work experience she hasn’t received yet. We can’t afford going the grad school route and she’s almost desperate enough to pick up a minimum wage job that doesn’t give the experience she needs. She’s feeling like she made a mistake earning her degree. 
With some light background out of the way, what are some good fresh-college-grad positions that will help earn my partner earn experience in HR/IO? 
It's my last semester of college and I finally graduate with a B.S. In Psychology. I'm both excited and scared. I still feel uncertain of what type of work I want to enter. With that said this major seems to limit me by being placed working with kids. I've been working with kids who are diagnosed with autism for the past 5 years. It's been great, but I'm ready to give something else a try. 
I want to know if there are any jobs out there for someone with a BS in Psychology that does not require a lot of human interaction. 
So I’ve finally decided that I want a career in psychology. I graduated HS 3 years ago & spent a semester at a university before dropping out. I’m interested in schools & programs online due to tuition and work. What are some good schools online for psych & how do I choose one? Should I go for a more well-known online-only university or online programs offered by 4-year schools (i.e., distance learning programs)? 
Hey all,
I got a BS in Psychology 11 years ago and now looking at my options to go back to school for my masters. 
I'm interested in the holistic side of psychology -- how a healthy lifestyle affects the mind and also self development, incl-  wilderness, recreational & art therapy, dream and sleep therapy.  Interested in having a private practice and also running retreats one day to help fairly high functioning people achieve their best and overcome challenges. Less interested in relationships (MFT for ex) and more into personal development at different stages of life. 
I'm thinking that since my interests are borderline "coaching" I may be fine with getting a masters (vs a PhD or PsyD) and then getting certified in the areas that interest me. Still open to going into a doctorate program, but for the sake of this post, I'll focus on Masters.
My questions: 
Do I need to study in the same place that I'm planning on practicing (I live in northern California)? I would be open to studying in another state or even country if not.  
Are there any GOOD masters programs you could recommend I look into, based on my interest areas? I know that JFK University and CIIS in the Bay Area are known for these types of programs (Holistic / Integral psychology), but I'm not sure if I trust how good they would be . For ex, CIIS is not APA accredited. Both have iffy reviews from students. I do want a real degree that i can use in practice. 
Money is definitely an issue -- I just paid off my undergraduate debt this year -- so any public / more affordable ideas would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks for your help!
I want to do aim for a masters in psychology but I barely scraped by in math this year with a B. I hate math, but I don’t hate statistics and I love the other aspects of psychology. How relevant is it in actuality? 
Textbook definition says bipolar disorder is
a condition marked by a history of at least one manic episode
Does that mean people who are manic without depression are bipolar? Different internet sources have mixed definitions of bipolar disorder. And it's confusing because bipolar disorder used to be called manic-depression.
I have 3 years of exp running groups in a mental health (MH) ward, 3 years on a crisis MH phone line, 3 years in an inpatient hospital ward, previous work with a psychologist. I also have a BSc degree and MSc degree in clinical psych with both qualitative and quantitative research experience. I feel this is a decent amount of experience but I can’t even get an interview.. help!
Can anybody help me understand this question and how I should approach it?
To what extent are brain functions strictly localised within the cerebral cortex?
'To  address this question it is important to first define what ‘strictly  localized’ means in the context of your argument. This definition will  allow you to establish what evidence supports your definition of  strictly localized, and what evidence refutes this definition. The brain  performs many different types of function which could include broad  functions such as communicating information (distributed processing or  processing that involves networks of brain regions, like language), or  specialized functions, such as, simple cells in the visual cortex  responding to the orientation of edges in visual images.
The  most difficult aspect of this question is that the brain has many  functions that vary in complexity.  With a word limit of 2000 you will  need to make choices about which functions best elucidate the debate  about localization of function in the brain. A good essay will explain  clearly and concisely what ‘localization of function’ means and will  make use of this definition to structure the argument and evidence in  support of localization and against localization'.
So,  would I need to find a study that has evidence for it, discuss it. Then  find a study that refutes it, discuss it. Or would I need to discuss  two studies that has evidence for, discuss it and debate how it refutes  i.e criticism etc? Any advice on this would be appreciated.
Hello, I was here wondering if anyone could point me to good basic books I could start reading or any material so I can begin learning. There’s no particular reason as to why I’m interested in psychology just seems very interesting to learn about.

We’ve tried looking for entry level HR/IO assistant jobs, but they all seem to requirer work experience she hasn’t received yet.

For ex, CIIS is not APA accredited. Both have iffy reviews from students. I do want a real degree that i can use in practice. 
Money is definitely an issue -- I just paid off my undergraduate debt this year -- so any public / more affordable ideas would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks for your help!
I want to do aim for a masters in psychology but I barely scraped by in math this year with a B. I hate math, but I don’t hate statistics and I love the other aspects of psychology. How relevant is it in actuality? 
Textbook definition says bipolar disorder is
a condition marked by a history of at least one manic episode
Does that mean people who are manic without depression are bipolar? Different internet sources have mixed definitions of bipolar disorder. And it's confusing because bipolar disorder used to be called manic-depression.
I have 3 years of exp running groups in a mental health (MH) ward, 3 years on a crisis MH phone line, 3 years in an inpatient hospital ward, previous work with a psychologist. I also have a BSc degree and MSc degree in clinical psych with both qualitative and quantitative research experience. I feel this is a decent amount of experience but I can’t even get an interview.. help!
Can anybody help me understand this question and how I should approach it?
To what extent are brain functions strictly localised within the cerebral cortex?
'To  address this question it is important to first define what ‘strictly  localized’ means in the context of your argument. This definition will  allow you to establish what evidence supports your definition of  strictly localized, and what evidence refutes this definition. The brain  performs many different types of function which could include broad  functions such as communicating information (distributed processing or  processing that involves networks of brain regions, like language), or  specialized functions, such as, simple cells in the visual cortex  responding to the orientation of edges in visual images.
The  most difficult aspect of this question is that the brain has many  functions that vary in complexity.  With a word limit of 2000 you will  need to make choices about which functions best elucidate the debate  about localization of function in the brain. A good essay will explain  clearly and concisely what ‘localization of function’ means and will  make use of this definition to structure the argument and evidence in  support of localization and against localization'.
So,  would I need to find a study that has evidence for it, discuss it. Then  find a study that refutes it, discuss it. Or would I need to discuss  two studies that has evidence for, discuss it and debate how it refutes  i.e criticism etc? Any advice on this would be appreciated.
Hello, I was here wondering if anyone could point me to good basic books I could start reading or any material so I can begin learning. There’s no particular reason as to why I’m interested in psychology just seems very interesting to learn about.

I am just about to start my first year bachelor of psychological science in Australia and was wondering what people did in relation to textbooks including: 
- When they found was best to buy their needed books ( before starting or within a few weeks) 
- whether people preferred electronic textbooks over paper (would it be cheaper in the long run to just print out from e-text what you want physically) 
- if buying the actual book did you buy it second hand cheaper or brand new ~ if so where from? 
Also to add if any one has any tips with the entire experience of University as well as being a psychology student. 
Thank you <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
I am currently entering my senior year of undergrad and am looking for a mentor for advice regarding extending my education, internships, recommended readings, etc. 
A sixth sense
From anecdotal observations it seems to me that there is some channel of communication other than the traditional senses. I guess it can only be something electromagnetic. It should not be difficult to test this. If it was already been tried with negative results, it may be because it is something subtle, and mobilizing the attention to detect it may compromise the perception. The attention of the person could be kept busy with some puzzle in order for the person to have a better perception.
I am 26 years olds with a BA in Psych from Purdue University. I graduated in 2015 and now I'm trying to decide if I go back to school, which is going to be more practical for knowledge and gainful employment. Since I already have my BA in Psych would it set me above to add on an Associates in Social Work? Or just add onto to my already somewhat useless degree. With my BA in Psych getting an associates in business, would that show more promising employment opportunities for administrative jobs, HR, etc. I've researched all this for weeks and can't come across anything definitive. I can't afford to go on and get a Masters in Psych or Social Work, plus if I did it would have to be online, I suck at online schooling and most of them aren't accredited anyways.  
If anyone has similar degrees or pursuing this same path, or with employment knowledge with these degrees it would be much appreciated and thank you for your time. 
I just graduated with a BA in Psychology. I would like to work in research for a few years and then pursue a PhD program. I have applied to so many labs at various universities and even some zoos, and had only heard back from one (rejected). Has anyone else experienced this? How do you actually get someone to look at your application or give you an interview?! I have tried follow up emails, no replies to any of them. 
Can you suggest some good blogs about psychology (with newest and authentic research and findings) for a to-be psychology student (undergraduate) in order to enrich knowledge and understanding of the field? Thanks!
I'm nearly finished just taking a few classes online. I want to apply for a public service education position through a school district (FT yearly), working with parents and students in early intervention. Would they over look me having not completed the degree just yet. At my school they post a list of students hired before graduation although I'm not sure if that means they already started or it's contingent on after that semester. If I have a shot any advice? Thank you!
Hello, I’m choosing what to study in university and I would like to talk to current psychology students about their experiences 
I'm an engineer major so I bought a "new" calculus 3 book. I never needed the wileyplus code so I never used it. However, after cleaning my room recently I found the code and figure to give it to someone for free. After searching up for what course or book the code was for all I could find online using the code "9781118431047" was something called "psychology in action". So i figured i would post it in this page to see if it would help anyone, so if anyone needs something like this the code is "C4975-46238-22524-921". 
What is the reason that different societies have evolved different codes of morality? 
As someone who is basically an atheist now, I can't help but wonder if I have been myself been brainwashed by a different code of morality causing me to leave religion.
Another question arises- if morality really is just a human construct, how are we to know that our current code of morality is sensible?
Basically, what is morality?
I'm looking for colleges nearby, and the only one near me offers applied psychology. I don't really understand the difference. I'm  in highschool now, and am going to start my senior year. I've taken Psychology previously and loved it, I'm not to sure about a degree in applied psych?
Hello fellow Students,
I have a research paper that I need to do for Principles of Psychology. I kinda have a topic but I'm not sure it even falls into the "psychology" studies category. The Rubric is very generic. The instructor gave us almost free reign over the topic as long as its psychologically orientated/based. Bellow is the start of the Paper, but I'm not sure it counts as psychology per say. Can I get some feedback?
P.S
Let me know if I need to explain anything in more detail in order to get feedback sometimes I'm far too General at the start of my papers. Thanks!
The Human Organism
And its Biological Reflection
Humans have always congregated into community’s since we were hunter gathering society’s. We have developed culturally and technologically since that time, creating a huge human organism worldwide to survive. This organism’s reflection is one of biological systems that evolution has created over millions of years. Humans are not creating new systems just imitating the environment they evolved in.
I can't seem to ever focus my attention on a carrier/hobbie and it is really putting a stop to my life, personal growth, maturity, etc. When I do find something interesting I do look into it quite a lot ( I don't become extremely interested ) and then point my life focus to whatever I become most immersed in. Currently, my main interest is psychology but that may change. What is this?
Hi everyone, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.
I'm a 35 year old IT professional, and I've been a Federal contractor in Missouri for 2.5 years making ~$75,000 yr.
My job is pretty secure and the workload is very relaxed. 
Moving on, for the past 2-3 years I have had a desire to make a meaningful change. I really enjoy thinking about people and what makes us who we are and how we tick. I've recently started thinking heavily about working towards a career in Clinical Psychology. 
My formal education is pretty much non-existent aside from a few random Art courses a thousand years ago, so I'd have to start school from the beginning. I understand this will take many many years of hard work and of course money... Bottom line is I've been feeling like I haven't done enough of anything truly meaningful. I've always been the "listener and advice giver" because of my empathetic nature, and I very much enjoy it. 
Do you think the course workload is possible while maintaining a full time job? 
Is a career change at 35 even possible or worth it for that matter?
Is online a viable option for Psychology courses?
The salary is not as important to me as the potential rewarding work.
Basically I'd love to hear your opinions and thoughts on making a change such as this. 
Thank you again!
Hi Sub,
My gf and I recently graduated with Bachelor degrees, I received mine in Info systems and she received hers in Psychology. 
I’ve got an idea of what to work towards but my gf has no idea what to do now.  We’ve tried looking for entry level HR/IO assistant jobs, but they all seem to requirer work experience she hasn’t received yet. We can’t afford going the grad school route and she’s almost desperate enough to pick up a minimum wage job that doesn’t give the experience she needs. She’s feeling like she made a mistake earning her degree. 
With some light background out of the way, what are some good fresh-college-grad positions that will help earn my partner earn experience in HR/IO? 
It's my last semester of college and I finally graduate with a B.S. In Psychology. I'm both excited and scared. I still feel uncertain of what type of work I want to enter. With that said this major seems to limit me by being placed working with kids. I've been working with kids who are diagnosed with autism for the past 5 years. It's been great, but I'm ready to give something else a try. 
I want to know if there are any jobs out there for someone with a BS in Psychology that does not require a lot of human interaction. 
So I’ve finally decided that I want a career in psychology. I graduated HS 3 years ago & spent a semester at a university before dropping out. I’m interested in schools & programs online due to tuition and work. What are some good schools online for psych & how do I choose one? Should I go for a more well-known online-only university or online programs offered by 4-year schools (i.e., distance learning programs)? 
Hey all,
I got a BS in Psychology 11 years ago and now looking at my options to go back to school for my masters. 
I'm interested in the holistic side of psychology -- how a healthy lifestyle affects the mind and also self development, incl-  wilderness, recreational & art therapy, dream and sleep therapy.  Interested in having a private practice and also running retreats one day to help fairly high functioning people achieve their best and overcome challenges. Less interested in relationships (MFT for ex) and more into personal development at different stages of life. 
I'm thinking that since my interests are borderline "coaching" I may be fine with getting a masters (vs a PhD or PsyD) and then getting certified in the areas that interest me. Still open to going into a doctorate program, but for the sake of this post, I'll focus on Masters.
My questions: 
Do I need to study in the same place that I'm planning on practicing (I live in northern California)? I would be open to studying in another state or even country if not.  
Are there any GOOD masters programs you could recommend I look into, based on my interest areas? I know that JFK University and CIIS in the Bay Area are known for these types of programs (Holistic / Integral psychology), but I'm not sure if I trust how good they would be . For ex, CIIS is not APA accredited. Both have iffy reviews from students. I do want a real degree that i can use in practice. 
Money is definitely an issue -- I just paid off my undergraduate debt this year -- so any public / more affordable ideas would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks for your help!
I want to do aim for a masters in psychology but I barely scraped by in math this year with a B. I hate math, but I don’t hate statistics and I love the other aspects of psychology. How relevant is it in actuality?
